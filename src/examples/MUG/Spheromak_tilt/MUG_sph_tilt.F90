!!MUG Example: Spheromak Tilt    {#doc_mug_sph_ex1}
!!=========================
!!
!![TOC]
!!
!! This example demonstrates the use of \ref doc_mhd_main "MUG"
!! to model the ideal tilt instability in a spheromak confined in a "tall" cylindrical flux conserver.
!! Such a system is unstable to this instability when the ratio of the cylinder's height to radius is
!! greater than 1.3. This result was shown first by [Bondeson and Marklin](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.863579),
!! where the instablity acts to dissipate energy and drive the magnetic configuration toward the Taylor state
!! (see \ref doc_mug_sph_ex1_ic).
!!
!!\section doc_mug_sph_ex1_code Code Walk Through
!!
!! The code consists of three basic sections, required imports and variable definitions,
!! finite element setup, and system creation and solution.
!!
!!\subsection doc_mug_sph_ex1_code_inc Module Includes
!! The first thing that we must do is include the OFT modules which contain
!! the required functions and variables. It is good practice to restrict the included elements
!! to only those needed. This is done using the `ONLY:` clause to specifically include only
!! certain definitions. The exceptions to this practice are the \ref oft_local and \ref oft_base
!! modules, which contain a controlled set of commonly used elements that can be safely imported
!! as a whole.

!!\subsection doc_mug_sph_ex1_ic Computing Initial Conditions
!!
!! The spheromak mode corresponds to the thrid lowest force-free eignstate of the
!! flux conserver. This can be computed using the \ref taylor::taylor_hmodes
!! "taylor_hmodes" subroutine and with the desired number of modes set to three.
!! The fact that this mode is the third eigenstate is indicative of the ideal
!! instability we wish to simulate with this example as there are two magentic
!! configurations (actually a sin/cosine-like pair) that contain less energy
!! for a given helicity. As a result, we would expect an instability to exist
!! that will drive the configuration toward one of these minimum energy states.
!! This also leads us to our choice of an intial perturbation to the equilibrium,
!! which we will chose to match field of the lowest eigenstate.
CALL taylor_hmodes(3)
CALL oft_lag_set_level(oft_lagrange_nlevels)
!! The \ref taylor::taylor_hmodes "taylor_hmodes" subroutine computes the vector
!! potential for each of the requested eignestates. However, the MHD
!! solver uses magnetic field as the primary variable. With force-free eigenstate
!! solutions the vector potential and magentic field can be related by a gauge
!! transformation. Here this fact is used to produce an appropriate initial
!! condition from the vector potential without changing the representation
!! order or projecting the field.
!!
!! The gauge is transformed using a \ref oft_h1_operators::h1_divout "divergence cleaning"
!! procedure to remove divergence from the vector potential by adding a gradient.
!! The \ref taylor::taylor_hmodes "taylor_hmodes" already sets the gauge such that
!! $\nabla \cdot \textbf{A} = 0$, however it does so while enforcing $\textbf{A} \times \hat{\textbf{n}} = 0$.
!! We now recompute the desired gauge fixing with the boundary condition $\textbf{A} \cdot \hat{\textbf{n}} = 0$,
!! which provides a suitable initialization magnetic field. This process is performed
!! on both the equilibrium and perturbing fields.

!!

!! These routines both advance the solution in time with the physics specified in the input file,
!! see the documentation for \ref xmhd::xmhd_lin_run "xmhd_lin_run" and \ref xmhd::xmhd_run "xmhd_run",
!! and produces restart files that contain the solution at different times.
!!
!! Several quantities are also recorded to a history file `xmhd.hist` during
!! the simulation, including the toroidal current (where the symmetry axis is specified by \ref xmhd::xmhd_taxis
!! "xmhd_taxis"). The data in the history file may be plotted using the script
!! `plot_mug_hist.py`, which is located in `src/utilities/scripts` or `python` directories for the
!! repository and an installation respectively.
!!
!! \note OFT plotting scripts require the python packages `numpy` and `matplotlib` as well
!! as path access to the python modules provided in `python` for installations or `src/utilities` in the repo.

!!\subsection doc_mug_sph_ex1_input_solver Solver specification
!!
!! Time dependent MHD solvers are accelerated significantly by the use of
!! a more sophisticated preconditioner than the default method. Below is
!! an example `oft_in.xml` file that constructs an appropriate ILU(0) preconditioner.
!! Currently, this preconditioner method is the suggested starting preconditioner for all
!! time-dependent MHD solves.
!!
!!```xml
!!<oft>
!!  <xmhd>
!!    <pre type="gmres">
!!      <its>8</its>
!!      <nrits>8</nrits>
!!      <pre type="block_jacobi">
!!        <nlocal>-1</nlocal>
!!        <solver type="ilu"></solver>
!!      </pre>
!!    </pre>
!!  </xmhd>
!!</oft>
!!```
!!
!! This solver can be used by specifying both the FORTRAN input and XML input files
!! to the executable as below.

!!\section doc_mug_sph_ex1_post Post-Processing options
!!
!! During the simulation the evolution of some global quantities is written to the history file `xmhd.hist`. A utility
!! script (`plot_mug_hist.py` located in `bin` after installation) is included as part of OFT for plotting the signals in this file.
!! This is useful for monitoring general progress of the simulation as well as numerical parameters like the iteration
!! count and solver time. Using this script we can see the instability growth and relaxation of the initial magnetic
!! equilibrium to the lowest energy state.

!!\subsection doc_mug_sph_ex1_post_plot Creating plot files
!!
!! To generate 3D plots, and perform additional diagnostic sampling (see \ref xmhd::oft_xmhd_probe "oft_xmhd_probe"), a plot run can
!! be performed by setting `plot_run=T` in the `sph_tilt_options` input group, which calls \ref xmhd::xmhd_plot "xmhd_plot". With this option
!! additional run time options are available in the `xmhd_plot_options` group that control how restart files are sampled for plotting.
