Using Doxygen    {#doc_doxygen}
=============

[TOC]

The Open FUSION Toolkit uses [Doxygen](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to create structured and
navigable documentation from the source code and structured comments. When adding
new components or modifying exisiting elements the associated documentation should be
updated to allow easy reference. For information on Doxygen specific commands which can
be used to supplement documentation see the Doxygen
[documentation](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html).

\section doc_doxygen_build Building documentation

Documentation can be built from the `src/docs` directory by running the following command,
where `/path/to/doxygen` is the location of the doxygen executable on your computer. This
will create a folder `src/../doc/html` which contains the updated documentation.

\verbatim
~$ /path/to/doxygen doxy_oft.conf
\endverbatim
