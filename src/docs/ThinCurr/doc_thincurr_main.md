Talk about ThinCurr...

ThinCurr is used through four driver programs:

 - \ref thincurr_eig for eigenvalue calculations
 - \ref thincurr_td for time-dependent runs
 - \ref thincurr_fr for frequency-response (frequency-domain) runs
 - \ref thincurr_from_mode to convert plasma mode structures to a current potential source

The following examples illustrate usage of ThinCurr to perform calculations using the thin-wall model.
