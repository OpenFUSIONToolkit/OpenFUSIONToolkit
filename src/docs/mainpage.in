=======

[TOC]

The Open FUSION Toolkit (OFT) is a finite element framework designed for simulating physical systems relevant to
plasma and fusion science and engineering in complex 2D and 3D geometries. The code supports
the use of high order finite element methods on an unstructured hexahedral/quadrilateral and
tetrahedral/triangular grids.

The code is fully open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hansec/OpenFUSIONToolkit).

\section doc_main_modules Physics Modules

Currently the framework is used to implement the following physics modules:

 - \ref doc_gs_main "TokaMaker": Free-boundary Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solver (static and time-dependent)
 - \ref doc_tw_main "ThinCurr": 3D thin-wall electromagnetic simulation package
 - \ref doc_mhd_main "MUG": 3D linear/nonlinear extended MHD simulation package
 - \ref doc_taylor_main "Marklin": 3D force-free, uniform \f$ \lambda \f$ equilibrium solver

\section doc_main_build Building OFT
The documentation for [Building OFT](https://github.com/hansec/OpenFUSIONToolkit/wiki) on different platforms
is maintained on GitHub along with the source code. At present, OFT is actively used both on macOS and Linux.

\section doc_main_api Framework modules and API

This section provides library examples and documentation to describe usage of OFT and its API
to modify existing or build new physics modules. The framework and API components are also roughly
grouped by the provided functionality (eg. \ref grid "meshing" modules). Listings of individual
FORTRAN modules and classes are also included along with an index of all modules, types, and
functions present in the API.

\warning The detailed documentation is under active development and may contain errors, use with care.

\section doc_main_api_ex Programming Examples

The following is a list of documented examples for using the OFT API

 - \ref doc_gs_main_ex "TokaMaker examples"
 - \ref doc_tw_main_ex "ThinCurr examples"
 - \ref doc_mhd_main_ex "MUG examples"
 - \ref doc_taylor_main "Marklin examples"
 - **Core API examples**
  - \ref doc_api_ex1
  - \ref doc_api_ex2

Further examples exist in the \ref testing "regression tests" sub-folders `src/tests/*`.

\section doc_main_writing Writing Documentation

OFT uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) to create structured and navigable
documentation from the source code and structured comments. For more information on how to write
in source documentation blocks, add documentation pages, and create new example programs/modules
see \ref doc_doxygen.

\section doc_main_git Using GIT

OFT uses [GIT](http://git-scm.com/) for version control. For information on how to use GIT
see the official [documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) or the unofficial example
based [documentation](http://gitready.com/).
